# About Server Security [Must Read]

## Warning
**Please pay close attention to the following content to ensure the safety of your assets:**

- **Default security measures are enabled:** The server has enabled relevant security features by default to protect players' assets, so there's no need for players to configure them separately.

## CoreProtect Protection (CoreProtect Plugin)

CoreProtect is a powerful data logging and anti-griefing tool. When you encounter unintentional or malicious damage from other players due to forgetting to claim your territory, you can apply to the administrators for restoration of the damaged area data.

### CoreProtect Usage Guide
For detailed information on how to use CoreProtect to protect your assets, please refer to: [CoreProtect Usage Guide]

### Land Claim Reminder
**If you forget to claim your land and lose items:**
- Don't worry, you can try to recover the lost property by contacting the administrators. However, please note that this service can only be used once every six months.
- Therefore, we strongly recommend that you claim your personal territory in a timely manner to reduce unnecessary trouble and alleviate the burden on the management team. (Hurry up and claim your land, making our lives easier!)
