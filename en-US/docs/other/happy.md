# Happiness

## Hey! Are you having fun? I've got just the formula here that measures your joy in the realm of MistMC.

$$
     H = \frac{\int_{0}^{T} e^{(a\cdot t)} \, dt \cdot \left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n \cdot f_n\right)}{\sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{I} g_i^2\right) \cdot \left(\prod_{j=1}^{J} h_j\right)}}
$$

## Oh, can't calculate it? No worries, you're already having a great time!
### Remember, keep smiling every day! â™¥
