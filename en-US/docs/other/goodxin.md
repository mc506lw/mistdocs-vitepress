# Our Beliefs

In today's diverse Minecraft server environment, players can enjoy a wide range of unique experiences and gameplay.

Unfortunately, some servers focus on profit as their core, with high in-game item prices or barriers to play that encourage paid access. This undoubtedly erodes the fairness and essence of fun in the game.

## Lan·Domain Server hereby clearly states: We are not in pursuit of short-term gains, and we will not tolerate any form of money-grabbing behavior.

## We solemnly promise that all profits from the Lan·Domain Server will be fully invested in the maintenance and upgrading of the server.

## Our profit model is not for personal gain but purely to balance operational costs, ensure server stability, and continuous content innovation, with no other motives.
