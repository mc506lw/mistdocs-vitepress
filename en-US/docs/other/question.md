# Frequently Asked Questions

## Question: Will the server be upgraded to a new version?
Answer: We promise that, unless there are major issues, the server will always remain the same and will not be upgraded.

## Question: Why can't I access the server?
Answer: Normally, accessing the server should be smooth and without obstruction. However, you might occasionally encounter difficulties in getting in. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

### Unknown host, unable to resolve hostname, network unreachable, Unknow host, Network is unreachable...

1. **Check the server address**  
   First, please make sure that the [server address](https://mistmc.top/docs/start#%E5%8D%B3%E5%88%BB%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F) is correctly typed in.

2. **Refresh DNS attempts**  
   Connection problems might occur if the current DNS tunnel you are using is having issues. Multiple attempts to refresh or reconnect might automatically switch to other normally functioning tunnels.
   
   > **Tip:**  
   > - When refreshing the server list or trying to join the server, the system will automatically re-query the DNS address. Just make sure that the server list occasionally connects successfully, and trying multiple times usually allows you to enter the game.

3. **Clear DNS cache**  
   If the address is correct, try [clearing the DNS cache](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/59a015e34fcd70f7948865a9.html), and then try connecting with the previous address again.

4. **Change DNS to 114DNS**  
   If the above step doesn't work, try changing your DNS server to [114DNS](https://www.114dns.com/faq.html#win7), and then [clear the DNS cache](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/59a015e34fcd70f7948865a9.html) again before attempting to connect.

If none of these methods solve the problem, there might be a global failure with the network penetration service, or the server might be undergoing maintenance.
