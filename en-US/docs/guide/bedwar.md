**Minecraft** Bed Wars Beginner's Tutorial:

1. **Game Objective**: Your main goal is to protect your bed and try to destroy the beds of other players or teams. As long as your bed remains intact, you can respawn infinitely.
2. **Collect Resources**: After the game starts, you need to collect resources on the map, such as iron ingots, gold ingots, diamonds, and emeralds. These resources can be used in the shop to purchase equipment and items, such as weapons, armor, blocks, and special items.
3. **Protect Your Bed**: You can use purchased blocks to protect your bed, preventing other players from destroying it. You can also buy traps and other defensive items to strengthen your defense.
4. **Attack Other Players**: Once you're ready, you can start attacking other players. You can use your weapons and tools to destroy their beds and defeat them.
5. **Teamwork (Team Mode)**: If you're playing in team mode, you need to work with your teammates. You can collect resources together, protect your beds, and attack other teams.
6. **Elimination and Victory**: If your bed is destroyed, you can no longer respawn. If you are defeated and your bed has been destroyed, you are eliminated. The last team (or individual) with players still alive is the winner.

Remember, Bed Wars is a game that requires strategy and skill. You need to make good use of your resources and develop your attack and defense strategies to win the game. Good luck!
