# Acquisition Methods

## Via Trading
You can obtain MistCoins through the [MistMC Market] or by trading with other players.

## Via Server Events
The server occasionally hosts events where you can earn a significant amount of MistCoins!

## Via Promotions
Simply by uploading videos to Bilibili, you can earn MistCoins and Cheese Rolls based on the number of views!
- Each view is equivalent to 2 MistCoins, rounded down to the nearest 50 (e.g., if you have 163 views, you will be credited with 150 MistCoins)
- A video can only be settled once (contact the admin in the Q group, and they will settle based on the current view count)
- Videos with 1,000 views or more are eligible for Cheese Roll rewards, with 1 Cheese Roll awarded for every 50 views
