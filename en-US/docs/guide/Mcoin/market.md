# MistMC Market
The MistMC Market offers the purchase of **selected items** only.
- You can use `/mm` to open the menu and enter the market.
- Alternatively, you can use `/shop` to access the market directly.

> The `/shop` command, which opens the store, can be used to jump to sub-stores directly, but it doesn't seem to be particularly useful.
