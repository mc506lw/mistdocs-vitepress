## Engaging in Voice Chat

### Close-range Voice Chat

1. After entering the game, press the default voice chat key (usually the `V` key). If you are unsure of the default key, you can check or change it in the settings.
2. When you press the key, you should see a voice chat prompt icon appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. Hold down the key and start speaking. Other players will be able to hear your voice.
4. After you finish speaking, release the key to stop voice transmission.

### Group Voice Chat

1. **Create or join a group**:
    - Press the group function key (usually the `C` key, or another key you have customized).
    - Choose to create a new group or join an existing group and select the members you want to join.

2. **Use the group for voice chat**:
    - In the group menu, select the group you want to have voice chat with.
    - Press the voice chat key (like the `V` key), and start speaking. Your words will only be heard in that group (unless it's an open group).
