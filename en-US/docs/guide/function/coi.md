# Punishing Thieves
Also known as the CoreProtect plugin.

In the game, you can use `/co i` to activate this tool.

Then right-click on the location where you lost your items to see who broke/placed this block.

Type `/co i` again to turn it off.

> **Note:** If it's a dispute over items within your territory, management will not intervene (so please be sure not to give away permissions to your territory to others casually).
