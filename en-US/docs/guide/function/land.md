# Land Claiming
## üí∞ Money Matters
Our server has invested in the‰ΩøÁî®ÊùÉ of the Lands plugin, which is quite a substantial expense. Please use and cherish this feature, sob sob~

The land claiming functionality on our server is fully reliant on the Lands plugin and supports defining the area of an entire chunk in one go!

### Basic Commands
- `/land menu`: Opens the menu to explore more features.
- `/land create [name]`: Creates your territory, customizing the territory name with a limit of 10 per person.
- `/land edit`: Select the territory you want to edit, **important note**: Always set the editing target before making any modifications!
- `/land claim auto`: Enters automatic land claiming mode, merging adjacent blocks you walk through into the currently edited territory.
- `/land setspawn`: Sets the spawn point within the territory, allowing for quick returns.

### Advanced Operations
We recommend managing other aspects directly from the territory menu for a user-friendly interface and intuitive operations.
