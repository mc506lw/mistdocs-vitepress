# Architect

- After tagging a manager in the QQ group, if the manager sees it, they will go to your territory to review your construction.
- If your construction is outstanding enough, you don't have to start from the apprentice level.
- How to obtain the title: After the construction passes the review, the manager will issue the title, which can be viewed in the menu (since the title is issued manually, it may not be timely, so don't worry if you don't get the title right away, the manager will issue it when they go online).
