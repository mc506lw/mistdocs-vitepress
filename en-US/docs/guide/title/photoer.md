# Photographer

- After posting in the QQ group album, the management will review it if they see it *(I suggest posting **@management** after you're done, they're busy or not is none of my business, I just need to write the webpage, right?)*
- Once accepted, you will receive the "Photographer" title and rewards, and your images may be featured on the official website or included in promotional posts *(I take back what I said...)*
- How to obtain the title: After the review is passed, the management will issue the title which can be viewed in the menu (since the title is manually issued, it may not be given out immediately, so don't worry if you don't receive the title right away, the management will issue it once they are online)*
