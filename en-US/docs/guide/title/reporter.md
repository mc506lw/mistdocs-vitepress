- After mentioning a moderator in a QQ group, if the moderator sees it, they will manually check your report history (it's recommended to mention the moderator in the group and then privately message them to avoid any unnecessary issues).
- How to obtain titles: Once you meet the requirements, the moderators will issue the title which you can check in the menu (since titles are issued manually, they may not be given out immediately. If you haven't received a title, don't worry; it will be issued once a moderator is online).
