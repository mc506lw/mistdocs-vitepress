## What is Slimefun?
**Slimefun** is a plugin dedicated to providing a mod-like experience. It offers everything you can think of, from backpacks to jetpacks! Slimefun allows every player to decide for themselves how they want to develop in terms of magic or technology.

From wands to nuclear reactors, it's all there. Moreover, Slimefun includes magical altars, energy networks, and even item transportation systems.

## How to open the Slimefun menu? (Skip if you're a brainiac)
Every player is assigned a book in the style of an enchanted book when they register their account. Hold this book in your hand and right-click, and you will enter an interface similar to a large chest. Don't worry, left-clicking on the icon button won't destroy the menu; the plugin recognizes this and will take you to the next level of the menu as if it were a mod. Right-clicking works similarly.
