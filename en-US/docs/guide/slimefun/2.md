# Introduction to Slimefun: Early Stages

Welcome to the wonderful world of Slimefun! Let's dive into the early stages of this magical plugin.

## 1. Unlocking the Basics
You'll find that most of Slimefun requires **experience** to unlock.

### How to Gain Experience Points
Experience can be earned through various activities, including:
- **Mining**
- **Killing or breeding mobs**
- **Fishing**
- **Using a grindstone to remove enchantments**
- **Using a furnace**

You can also borrow a enderman tower from experienced players. If you want to know who has one, just ask around in the server. 
* **Note**: We recommend that you build your own enderman tower if possible. Check out the [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com) for tutorials on how to build one.

### What Should I Unlock First?
In the early stages, you must unlock:
- The basic machines: Grindstone, Automatic Sieve, and Ore Washer;
- Resources: Copper Ingots (unlocking this will also unlock other resources like Zinc Ingots, Lead Ingots, etc.).

## 2. Using Basic Machines
Most basic machines are **multi-block structures**. To use them, simply place them on the ground as shown in the diagrams.

* If there is a **dispenser**:
  - First, place the items into the dispenser according to the recipe (if the machine has one).
  - Then right-click on the **interactive block** (*usually a crafting table, trapdoor, brewing stand, fence, etc.*) to activate the machine. The dispenser will consume the materials and generate the item you're crafting.

* If there is no dispenser (*e.g., Automatic Sieve*):
  - The machine will directly consume the materials and spit out the crafted item.

Now, place an Advanced Workbench, Grindstone, Automatic Gold Pan, and Ore Washer on the ground and try them out!

## 3. Obtaining Dust
#### What is this and why is it important?
This is the most basic and important raw material in Slimefun. From various alloys to reactors, dust is indispensable.

#### How to obtain it?
There are many ways, but here are three common methods:

First method:
- Create a Gold Pan in the **Advanced Workbench**;
- Right-click on gravel with the Gold Pan in hand to get a chance of obtaining sieved ores and some junk;
- Place the sieved ores into the **Ore Washer** to get various types of dust.

Second method:
- Place ores into the **Grindstone** to crush them into gravel;
- Right-click on the trapdoor of the **Automatic Gold Pan** with gravel in hand to get a chance of obtaining sieved ores and some junk;
- Place the sieved ores into the **Ore Washer** to get various types of dust.

Third method:
- For resources like **Copper, Iron, Gold** that exist in the original Minecraft, you can place the raw ores or rough ores into the **Crusher** to obtain dust.

**Once you have unlocked the basic machines and learned how to operate them, you're ready to move on to the next stageâ€”Mid.**
